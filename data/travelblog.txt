About Kate
My name is Kate McCulley and I travel the world for a living.

I’ve been shipwrecked in Indonesia. I’ve gone swimming in the frigid waters of Antarctica. I’ve partied with Ernest Hemingway lookalikes in Key West, cheered on the world air guitar champions in Finland, and danced until dawn with fire-throwing Vikings in the Shetland Islands. And I’ve traveled alone in places as far-flung as Lebanon, Colombia, and South Africa.

I’m a 40-year-old woman originally from the Boston area. After four years of establishing a career in online marketing and a lifetime dreaming of traveling the world, I decided that it was time to make it happen.

In September 2010, at the age of 26, I quit my job to travel Southeast Asia for six months. Six months turned into 13 years across 85 countries and 7 continents.

While in Southeast Asia, I worked on developing this site along with building a freelance work portfolio. After returning to the U.S. in May 2011, I realized that I was making almost enough money to support myself full-time. With a little ramping up, I wouldn’t have to go back to a conventional job. So I ramped it WAY up — and travel blogging has been my full-time job ever since.

In early 2016, I decided it was time to slow down and moved to New York City. I downsized my travels from 70% of the time to 25% of the time.

In 2017, Forbes named me one of the top 10 most influential travelers, and Irish America named me one of the top Irish American Business Leaders.

As fantastic as New York was, after four years, I was ready for a change. I left New York in late 2019 — but then COVID hit and put everything on hold.

Travel businesses around the world were decimated by COVID, mine included. I nearly lost everything I had built over the past decade. But I’ve taken this as an opportunity to pivot and create new kinds of content for you.

I also offer private blog consulting (all niches!) where I do a full audit of your blog and tell you exactly where you should be focusing, and one-on-one calls with readers where we can talk about anything you’d like for 45 minutes.
In 2020, I moved to Prague, starting a new chapter. I live here with my then-boyfriend Charlie and we adopted two cats, Lewis and Murray.

In 2021, I won Croatia’s Golden Pen Grand Prix, the top travel writing award in the country, for my coverage of Croatia travel during the pandemic.

In 2022, I started my new site: New Hampshire Way, a guide to New Hampshire travel.

In 2023, Charlie and I got married! We had three weddings and thus three honeymoons: a quick micro-moon in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic; a long weekend in Ischia and Naples, Italy; and a monthlong trip through Chile and Argentina!

In 2024, I was named the TravMedia Awards Blogger of the Year, and I turned 40 in style in Croatia.

Still traveling? Hell yes. Traveling is one of the most important things in my life, even now.
